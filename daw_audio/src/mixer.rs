//! Per-track scratch buffers used by the audio worker.
//!
//! The audio engine's worker pool reuses one `TrackScratch` per track every
//! buffer — track audio output and the MIDI ping-pong buses live here so
//! the RT loop never allocates. Cache-line aligned to keep concurrent
//! workers from false-sharing each other's scratch.
